## Task 2: Stacking
This operation involves building a vertical stack using tokens that are initially located in separate sections (one for circles and one for squares). The robot retrieves the pieces one by one to construct a single tower at a designated point. The assembly sequence begins with a circular piece as the base, merging all separate components into a unified stack.
